Description: ROCm Communication Collectives Library - library
 RCCL (pronounced "Rickle") is a library of collective communication routines
 built on the AMD ROCm platform and optimized for discrete AMD GPUs. It
 implements routines such as all-reduce, all-gather, reduce, broadcast,
 reduce-scatter, gather, scatter and all-to-all. The library is optimized for
 high bandwidth over channels including PCIe, xGMI, InfiniBand Verbs or TCP/IP
 sockets and supports an arbitrary number of GPUs.
 .
 This package provides the RCCL library.

Description: ROCm Communication Collectives Library - tests
 RCCL (pronounced "Rickle") is a library of collective communication routines
 built on the AMD ROCm platform and optimized for discrete AMD GPUs. It
 implements routines such as all-reduce, all-gather, reduce, broadcast,
 reduce-scatter, gather, scatter and all-to-all. The library is optimized for
 high bandwidth over channels including PCIe, xGMI, InfiniBand Verbs or TCP/IP
 sockets and supports an arbitrary number of GPUs.
 .
 This package provides the RCCL test binaries used for verifying that the
 library is functioning correctly. These binaries are only used to check whether
 RCCL works correctly on a given GPU, so generally speaking, users probably
 don't need this package.
